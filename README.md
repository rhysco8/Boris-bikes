# Boris-bikes

This is a Makers Academy week 1 challenge undertaken by Rhys, Monika and Celia.

This will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) for a network of bikes and uses across London

Currently you can release a bike from a docking station if there is a bike in it.
